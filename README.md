## Summary

I built this app to understand and learn the React front end framework, along with working with external API data. There were a lot of new things to tackle on this project. I am starting to build tougher applications that are a bit closer to real world projects. I know this isn't a massive project, but being comfortable with the React framework along with Javascript really starts to bring the project into persepective.

Up to this point the projects I have worked on have been using static data or data that has been provided by the user. This application was a great opportunity to look deeper into how the web works. Not to mention how React frameworks brings it all together.

Specific things I used and learned while building this application:

> React Hooks including useState & useEffect

> Using axios library

> Styling React with Bootstrap 5

> Deployment onto Heroku cloud service

> API calls to swapi.dev to get Star Wars data information
